### üîπ Types of Wi-Fi Cards

| Type                             | Description                                                                           | Example Devices                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Internal (built-in)**          | Comes pre-installed on laptops or motherboards. Connects via PCIe or M.2 slot.        | Modern laptops, desktops       |
| **External (USB Wi-Fi Adapter)** | Plug-and-play devices that connect through USB ports. Useful for desktops or repairs. | PCs without built-in Wi-Fi     |
| **Mini PCI / M.2 Card**          | Smaller cards installed inside laptops, used by manufacturers.                        | Thin laptops, embedded systems |

### üîπ How It Works (Flow of Communication)

1. **Wi-Fi card scans** for nearby wireless networks (using its antenna).
2. It **detects a Wi-Fi signal** broadcast by an **access point (router)**.
3. Once you connect, it performs **authentication** and **encryption** (WPA2, WPA3, etc.).
4. It **transmits and receives data packets** via **radio waves**.
5. The OS **uses the driver** of the card to convert data between wireless signals and digital data the computer can use.

### üîπ Technical Details

* **Frequencies:** 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands (Wi-Fi 6 and 6E add 6 GHz).
* **Protocols Supported:** IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax.
* **Data Rate:** From a few Mbps (old cards) up to multiple Gbps (Wi-Fi 6).
* **Antenna:** Can be internal (laptop) or external (desktop adapters).

### üîπ Real-World Analogy

Think of a Wi-Fi card as the **‚Äúears and mouth‚Äù** of your computer for wireless communication ‚Äî
it listens to signals from the router and speaks back in radio waves so data can travel without wires.
