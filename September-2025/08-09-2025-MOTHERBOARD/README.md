### ðŸ”¹ **Major Components on a Motherboard**

1. **CPU Socket**

   * A special slot where the processor (CPU) is installed.
   * Different motherboards support different CPU types (Intel, AMD).

2. **RAM Slots (Memory Slots / DIMM Slots)**

   * Long slots for installing RAM sticks.
   * Usually 2â€“8 slots, depending on the motherboard.

3. **Chipset**

   * Divided into **Northbridge** (older motherboards) and **Southbridge**, or just a single chipset in modern boards.
   * Controls communication between CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, and peripherals.

4. **BIOS/UEFI Chip**

   * A small chip that stores the firmware.
   * Responsible for booting up the system before the operating system loads.

5. **Expansion Slots (PCIe, PCI)**

   * Used for add-on cards: graphics card, sound card, Wi-Fi card, capture card, etc.
   * PCIe x16 is common for GPUs.

6. **Power Connectors**

   * **24-pin ATX connector**: main power from PSU.
   * **4/8-pin CPU power connector**: for processor.
   * Additional connectors for GPUs (if needed).

7. **Storage Connectors**

   * **SATA ports**: for HDDs, SSDs, and optical drives.
   * **M.2 slots**: for NVMe SSDs (modern, very fast).

8. **I/O Ports (Back Panel Connectors)**

   * USB ports, Ethernet (LAN), HDMI/DisplayPort (if integrated GPU), audio jacks, PS/2 (legacy keyboard/mouse).

9. **CMOS Battery**

   * A small coin-cell battery that powers the BIOS settings clock and keeps system settings even when the PC is off.

10. **Cooling System Mounts & Fan Headers**

    * Connectors for CPU fan, case fans, and liquid cooling pumps.

### ðŸ”¹ **Smaller but Important Components**

* **VRMs (Voltage Regulator Modules):** Regulate power to the CPU and RAM.
* **Crystal Oscillator:** Keeps system timing stable.
* **Capacitors & Transistors:** Help manage power and signal flow.
* **Heat sinks:** Passive cooling for chipsets and VRMs.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
The **biggest and most obvious components** youâ€™ll see on a motherboard are the CPU socket, RAM slots, chipset, expansion slots, and storage connectors. The **smaller ones** (VRMs, capacitors, battery) work silently in the background to keep everything stable.
