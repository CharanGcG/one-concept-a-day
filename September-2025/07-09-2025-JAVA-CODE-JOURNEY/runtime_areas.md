Perfect ðŸ”¥ letâ€™s move on to the **Runtime Data Areas (JVM Memory Model)**. Iâ€™ll keep the same **README-style documentation** format for consistency.

# ðŸ“˜ JVM Runtime Data Areas â€“ Documentation

## ðŸ”¹ What are Runtime Data Areas?

The **Runtime Data Areas** are the **memory regions inside the JVM** where program data is stored during execution.

* Each Java program gets these memory areas when the JVM starts.
* Some areas are **shared across all threads**, while others are **private to each thread**.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as the **RAM layout of the JVM**.

---

## ðŸ§© Components of Runtime Data Areas

### 1. **Method Area (a.k.a. Class Area / MetaSpace)**

* **Shared** across all threads.
* Stores class-level metadata:

  * Class names, method names, field names.
  * Bytecode for methods.
  * Static variables.
  * Runtime constant pool (symbols, references).
* In Java 8+, **stored in Metaspace** (uses native memory instead of heap).

---

### 2. **Heap Area**

* **Shared** memory region.
* Stores all **objects** and **instance variables**.
* Garbage Collector (GC) operates here.
* Divided into:

  * **Young Generation** (new objects, frequent GC).
  * **Old Generation (Tenured)** (long-lived objects).
  * **Permanent Generation (PermGen)** â†’ replaced by Metaspace in Java 8.

---

### 3. **JVM Stack (per-thread)**

* Each thread gets its own **stack**.
* Stores **stack frames** for method calls.
* A stack frame contains:

  * Local variables.
  * Operand stack (intermediate calculations).
  * Reference to runtime constant pool.
* When a method is called â†’ a new frame is pushed.
* When method exits â†’ frame is popped.

---

### 4. **Program Counter (PC) Register (per-thread)**

* Each thread has its own PC register.
* Stores the **address of the current JVM instruction** being executed.
* Helps JVM resume execution after method calls or branches.

---

### 5. **Native Method Stack (per-thread)**

* Supports execution of **native (non-Java) code**, usually written in C/C++.
* Stores state of native method invocations.
* Works with JNI (Java Native Interface).

## ðŸ“Š Runtime Data Areas Structure

```
Runtime Data Areas
 â”œâ”€â”€ Shared by All Threads
 â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ Method Area (class metadata, static vars, bytecode)
 â”‚     â””â”€â”€ Heap (objects, instance vars, GC managed)
 â”‚
 â””â”€â”€ Per Thread
       â”œâ”€â”€ JVM Stack (stack frames: local vars, operands, references)
       â”œâ”€â”€ Program Counter Register (current instruction)
       â””â”€â”€ Native Method Stack (for JNI/native calls)
```

## âš¡ Example Walkthrough â€“ Memory in Action

```java
class Student {
    static String school = "ABC High"; // Method Area
    String name; // Heap

    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name; // Heap
    }

    void greet() {
        String msg = "Hello, " + name; // JVM Stack (local var)
        System.out.println(msg);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student("Alice"); // Heap
        s1.greet();
    }
}
```

**Execution Flow:**

1. `Student` class is loaded â†’ metadata + `school` stored in **Method Area**.
2. `s1` object is created â†’ stored in **Heap**.
3. `greet()` is called â†’ new **Stack Frame** created in JVM Stack.
4. Local variable `msg` stored in **JVM Stack**.
5. PC Register tracks which bytecode instruction is being executed.
6. If `System.out.println` needs native code â†’ handled in **Native Method Stack**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

* **Shared Areas:** Method Area + Heap.
* **Per Thread Areas:** JVM Stack, PC Register, Native Method Stack.
* Heap â†’ for objects.
* Method Area â†’ for class metadata.
* Stacks â†’ for method execution.
* PC Register â†’ instruction pointer.
* Native Method Stack â†’ JNI/native code support.

ðŸ‘‰ Together, these areas form the **memory backbone** of the JVM.

Would you like me to go even deeper and write a **README for the Class Loader Subsystem** next? (since itâ€™s another core part of JVM alongside Runtime Data Areas & Execution Engine)
