## 🔑 What is SSH?

![ssh diagram](/images/September-2025/23-09-2025/SSH_simplified_protocol_diagram-2.webp)

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a network protocol that allows secure communication between two computers over an unsecured network. It is mainly used to **remotely log into servers, execute commands, and transfer files** safely.

Think of it as a **secure tunnel** through which you can control and manage another computer.

## ⚡ Why SSH?

Before SSH, administrators used protocols like **Telnet** or **rlogin**, which sent data (including passwords) in plain text. That was risky because attackers could easily sniff traffic.
SSH solved this by providing:

* **Encryption** → Protects data from eavesdropping.
* **Authentication** → Ensures only trusted users can access.
* **Integrity** → Prevents data from being tampered with.

---

## 🛠️ How SSH Works (Simplified Flow)

1. **Connection initiated** → Client (your machine) requests a connection to the server on port **22** (default SSH port).
2. **Key exchange** → Both sides agree on encryption algorithms and exchange cryptographic keys securely.
3. **Authentication** → You log in with a **password** or a **public/private key pair**.
4. **Secure session** → Now, commands, data, or file transfers happen in an **encrypted channel**.

---

## 📂 Common Uses of SSH

* **Remote login:** `ssh user@server_ip`
* **File transfer:** Using `scp` or `sftp`
  Example: `scp file.txt user@server_ip:/home/user/`
* **Tunneling & Port forwarding:** Securely forward local or remote ports (used in DB access, VPN-like setups).
* **Automation:** DevOps and sysadmins use SSH keys for passwordless automation (e.g., Ansible, Git).

---

## 🔒 SSH Authentication Methods

1. **Password-based authentication** – simplest but less secure.
2. **Public-key authentication** – generates a key pair:

   * Private key stays with you.
   * Public key goes on the server.
   * Server only allows access if the private key matches.

---

## ⚖️ Analogy

Imagine you’re visiting a high-security building:

* **Telnet** = walking in with no ID → anyone can impersonate you.
* **SSH** = walking in with a government-issued ID + encrypted tunnel that blocks others from eavesdropping.

---

## 🖥️ Example in Action

```bash
# Connect to server
ssh charan@192.168.1.10  

# Copy file from local to server
scp notes.txt charan@192.168.1.10:/home/charan/  

# Copy file from server to local
scp charan@192.168.1.10:/home/charan/report.txt .
```

👉 So, in short:
**SSH = Secure remote access + encrypted file transfer + safe tunneling.**

---

That 'Shh the terminal' joke comes from the fact that **“ssh”** looks like someone saying *“shhh 🤫”* (to keep quiet). But in tech, **SSH** isn’t about silence at all—it’s a **command + protocol**.


### ✅ What “ssh the terminal” actually means

When a manager says *“SSH into the server/terminal”*, they mean:

👉 **Open a secure shell connection** from your computer (client) to another computer (server) using the `ssh` command.

Example:

```bash
ssh charan@192.168.1.10
```

This means:

* **ssh** → the program/command you’re using.
* **charan** → the username on the remote machine.
* **192.168.1.10** → the server’s IP address (or hostname, like `example.com`).

Once you run this, you’ll get a **secure terminal session** inside that remote machine. You can then run commands there as if you were physically using that computer.

---

### 🔑 So in plain words:

* **The meme:** "ssh 🤫" → *telling the terminal to keep quiet*
* **Reality:** "ssh" → *securely logging into a remote machine’s terminal*

---


Let’s break it down step by step.

Here’s what actually happens when you run something like:

```bash
ssh charan@192.168.1.10
```

## ⚡ Flow of Control in an SSH Session

![complete flow of ssh](/images/September-2025/23-09-2025/0224-how-does-ssh-work.png)

1. **You run the command**

   * Your machine (client) invokes the `ssh` program.
   * It parses the command → *username = charan, server = 192.168.1.10*.
   * It tries to connect to the server on **port 22** (default SSH port).

---

2. **Server responds**

   * The SSH server (`sshd`) on 192.168.1.10 receives the request.
   * It sends back its **host key** (server’s public identity).
   * Your client checks if it has seen this server before:

     * If **yes** → verifies the fingerprint matches (to prevent man-in-the-middle).
     * If **no** → asks *“Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”* and saves the server’s fingerprint in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

---

3. **Key exchange & encryption setup**

   * Both sides agree on an encryption algorithm (like AES, ChaCha20).
   * A **session key** is securely exchanged using public-key cryptography.
   * From now on, **everything is encrypted** (no one can sniff your traffic).

---

4. **Authentication**
   The server now asks: *“Prove you are charan.”*

   * If using **password authentication** → you type in your password, it is sent in **encrypted form**.
   * If using **public/private key pair** →

     * Client signs a challenge with your **private key**.
     * Server checks it against your stored **public key**.
     * If it matches → you’re authenticated without a password.

---

5. **Session established**

   * Once authenticated, you’re dropped into a **remote shell** (like Bash/Zsh).
   * From your terminal, you can now execute commands **directly on the remote machine**.
   * Example:

     ```bash
     ls
     cat logs.txt
     top
     ```

---

6. **Secure channel in use**

   * Every keystroke you type is **encrypted** → sent to the server.
   * Every response from the server is **encrypted** → sent back to you.
   * Nobody in between (like hackers or ISPs) can read the data.

---

7. **Closing the session**

   * When you type `exit` or close the terminal, the session ends.
   * The encryption keys are destroyed, connection closed.

---

### 🔑 Analogy

It’s like:

* You knock on a secure office door (**ssh command**).
* Guard checks your ID (**authentication**).
* You and the guard agree to use a secret code language (**encryption**).
* Once inside, you can safely talk to the office staff (**remote shell commands**).
* When you leave, the door locks again (**connection closed**).

---

My understading: "so its like, whatever command i type, it is securely sent to the server, it executes there, then the output is sent back to me securely, and is displayed on my screen, it feels like i am working on my own terminal, but the actual execution happens on the server"

💯 Exactly! You nailed it.

That’s precisely what SSH does:

1. **Your terminal (client)**

   * You type a command: `ls`

2. **Secure channel (via SSH encryption)**

   * The command travels encrypted over the network.

3. **Remote server (where you’re logged in)**

   * The server’s shell (e.g., Bash) actually executes `ls`.
   * The output (list of files) is generated.

4. **Back through the secure channel**

   * The output is encrypted → sent back to your machine.

5. **Your screen (client)**

   * SSH decrypts the output and displays it in *your* terminal.

---

### 🔑 The illusion

It feels like you’re working on **your local terminal**, but in reality:

* **Input (commands)** → sent securely to the server.
* **Processing** → done on the server.
* **Output (results)** → sent securely back to you.

That’s why admins can manage servers across the world just by opening an SSH session—it’s like *remote control for a computer, but text-based and encrypted*.
