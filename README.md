# ONCE_CONCEPT_A_DAY

Welcome to **once_concept_a_day** â€“ a personal journey where a curious Computer Science student explores and documents one concept each day, from software engineering, system design, and computer networks to algorithms, programming, and more.

## About This Repository

This repo serves as a structured logbook of daily technical exploration. Each day's entry is a Markdown file summarizing essential ideas, use cases, and insights gained about a chosen topic or technology.

- **Audience**: Primarily for personal reference and review, but anyone interested in concise, well-structured concept notes is welcome!
- **Format**: Every concept is captured in a standalone markdown file, optionally supplemented by code examples, diagrams, or reference links.

## Structure

- Concepts are organized by **month** and **date**, e.g.:
  ```
  images/
  September-2025/
    05-09-2025-WIFI-CONNECTION/
      README.md
    06-09-2025-GPU/
      README.md
  ```
- Any related images or resources are kept in the `images` folder or under the relevant date.

## How to Use

- Browse by **month** or **topic** folders.
- Each day's folder contains the markdown note titled `README.md`.
- Entries might include diagrams, code snippets, and references depending on the concept.

## Sample Topics

- GPU Architecture
- Wi-Fi Connection Principles
- System Design Patterns
- Networking Fundamentals
- Programming Paradigms

## Future Ideas

- Expand to include interactive notebooks or code.
- Add references, external resources, and related reading for in-depth study as needed.
