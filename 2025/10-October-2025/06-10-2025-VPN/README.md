# VPN (Virtual Private Network)

## **1. What is a VPN?**

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a service or technology that creates a **secure, encrypted connection** between your device (computer, phone, etc.) and another network over the Internet.

Think of it like a **tunnel**: everything you send or receive goes through this tunnel, so outsiders can’t see it.

## **2. Why use a VPN?**

1. **Privacy & Anonymity:**

   * Your IP address is hidden, and your online activity is encrypted.
   * This prevents ISPs, hackers, or governments from easily tracking you.

2. **Security on public networks:**

   * Public Wi-Fi (coffee shops, airports) is risky.
   * VPN encrypts your data so hackers can’t steal passwords, messages, or banking info.

3. **Access restricted content:**

   * Some websites or services are geo-blocked (Netflix, YouTube, etc.).
   * VPN can make it look like you’re in another country to bypass restrictions.

4. **Secure Remote Work:**

   * Companies use VPNs to let employees securely access internal networks from home.

## **3. How a VPN works (simplified)**

1. Your device → connects to a **VPN server**.
2. VPN server → sends your requests to the Internet.
3. Response comes back → VPN encrypts it → sends it to you.

So, anyone watching your network **only sees encrypted traffic to the VPN**, not the actual websites you visit.

**Diagram (text version):**

```
[Your Device] ---Encrypted---> [VPN Server] ---Internet---> [Website]

## **4. Key Components**

| Component  | Function                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VPN Client | Software on your device that connects to VPN server.                            |
| VPN Server | Receives traffic from clients, encrypts/decrypts data, forwards it to Internet. |
| Encryption | Scrambles your data so outsiders can’t read it.                                 |
| Protocols  | Rules for secure connection (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPSec, etc.)                   |

## **5. Types of VPN**

1. **Remote Access VPN:**

   * Connects individual users to a private network securely.
   * Example: Employees accessing company servers from home.

2. **Site-to-Site VPN:**

   * Connects two networks securely over the Internet.
   * Example: Offices in New York and London connected via VPN.

## **6. Popular VPN Protocols**

| Protocol  | Speed     | Security | Use Case                                |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| OpenVPN   | Moderate  | High     | General-purpose, secure VPN             |
| WireGuard | High      | High     | Modern, lightweight, fast               |
| IPSec     | Moderate  | High     | Site-to-site VPNs                       |
| PPTP      | Very High | Low      | Obsolete, insecure, only legacy support |

## **7. VPN vs Proxy**

| Feature            | VPN  | Proxy                    |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------ |
| Encrypts traffic   | ✅    | ❌                        |
| Hides IP           | ✅    | ✅                        |
| Works for all apps | ✅    | ❌ (usually browser only) |
| Security           | High | Low                      |

## **8. Practical Example**

* You’re in India and want to watch a US-only show.
* VPN connects to a US server → website thinks you’re in the US → you can watch the show safely.
* At the same time, your ISP can’t see what you’re watching because all traffic is encrypted.
